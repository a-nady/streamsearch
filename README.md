**StreamSearch**

A web app helping in finding which streaming service a movie/film belongs to, if it is on any. Users can have seperate watchlists where they can consolidate content between different services. User info is stored in MongoDB, passwordd authentication is done via passport.js. Webpages are rendered via React/Express.

To run locally (mongoDB install required for db access), go into the directory:
`npm install`

Run app.js via node, and access http://localhost:3000/ on a web browser
